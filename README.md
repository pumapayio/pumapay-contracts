## Overview

PumaPay Contracts is a library that provides smart contracts specifically for payments and financial instruments. 
This library is newly created and currently it only includes the Split Payment utility smart contracts. 

We are currently working on re-designing and re-developing out pull payment smart contracts in a much more flexible way. 
Coming soon..

For previous versions of the our smart contract check [here](https://github.com/pumapayio/pumapay-token) and [here](https://github.com/pumapayio/smart-contracts).

* Contracts are written in [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) and tested using [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) and [Ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli).
* All the smart contracts have been developed based on modules developed by [Open Zepellin](https://openzeppelin.org/).

## Testing
